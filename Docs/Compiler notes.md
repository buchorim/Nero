Notes on Nero Compilers
This document catalogs the compilers developed for the Nero programming language, providing insights into their purpose, status, and characteristics.

Note: The stable version of Nero may include or exclude certain compilers or features. Check the source code for the most accurate details.

Overview
As an experimental project by Arinara Network Studio, Nero includes multiple compilers to test its natural language-inspired syntax. These compilers vary in stability and functionality, reflecting different approaches to translating Nero code into executable programs.
Compiler Categories
Nero’s compilers are organized into three groups:

Stable Compilers:
Fully functional and tested, capable of compiling Nero programs reliably.
Suitable for running example programs or studying compiler design.


Experimental Compilers:
In-progress or untested, exploring new parsing or code generation techniques.
May be incomplete but offer valuable insights into Nero’s development.


Unsuccessful Compilers:
Attempts that failed to meet goals, preserved for learning purposes.
Useful for understanding challenges in compiler design.



Example Use Case
A stable compiler might process this Nero program:
Pake Nero
Atur umur 25
Tampilkan "Umurku " gabung umur gabung " tahun."
(Jalan)

This code sets a variable umur to 25 and prints “Umurku 25 tahun.” Experimental compilers might handle additional syntax, but their reliability varies.
Documentation Format
Each compiler is documented with:

Purpose: The intended functionality or experiment.
Status: Stable, experimental, or unsuccessful.
Notes: Limitations, unique features, or reasons for failure.


Important: The development team may have altered compilers in the stable version, affecting their behavior or availability. Refer to the source code for specifics.

Exploring Compilers
To study a compiler:

Locate Its Category: Check the repository’s compiler collections.
Review Source Code: Look for accompanying documentation or comments.
Test with Examples: Use tutorials to run sample programs with stable compilers.

This document serves as a reference for understanding the evolution of Nero’s compilers, offering a window into Arinara Network Studio’s experimental journey.
