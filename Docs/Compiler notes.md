Repository Organization Guide
This guide provides a clear overview of the Nero repository’s structure, helping you navigate its components with ease.

Note: The stable version of Nero may include changes to the repository’s contents. Verify details by checking the source code.

Purpose
The Nero repository, developed by Arinara Network Studio, is a final archive of an experimental programming language. Its organization is designed to make the project’s tools, documentation, and experiments accessible to users studying or exploring Nero.
Repository Structure
The repository is divided into several key areas, each serving a specific role:

Compiler Collections:
Stable: Contains compilers that reliably compile Nero programs.
Experimental: Stores untested or incomplete compilers for research purposes.
Unsuccessful: Archives compilers that did not meet expectations, kept for reference.


Documentation:
Guides covering Nero’s goals, repository layout, and compiler details.


Development Guides:
Technical resources for setting up and understanding Nero’s codebase.


Tutorials and Experiments:
Practical examples and notes on Nero’s features and development tests.


Project Metadata:
Includes the project license, main overview, and version control settings.
