Introduction to Nero
Nero is an experimental open-source programming language crafted by Arinara Network Studio. Its mission is to make programming feel as natural as writing in everyday language, using syntax like Tanyakan "Siapa namamu?" simpan ke nama (Ask "What is your name?" save to name). This repository captures the final state of Nero’s development, though the stable version may include variations introduced by the development team.

Note: The stable version of Nero may differ from this documentation due to additions or removals by Arinara Network Studio. Always check the source code for the latest details.

Project Vision
Nero was designed to push the boundaries of programming language design with the following goals:

Intuitive Syntax: Create a language that feels like a conversation, lowering the barrier for beginners.
Educational Value: Serve as a learning tool for understanding compiler design and programming concepts.
Cross-Platform Support: Run on diverse environments, including Android (via Termux) and desktop systems.
Open-Source Freedom: Released under the MIT license for unrestricted use and study.

Why Nero?
Nero stands out for its human-centric approach. For example, a simple program might look like this:
Pake Nero
Tanyakan "Siapa namamu?" simpan ke nama
Tampilkan "Halo, " gabung nama gabung "!"
(Jalan)

This code asks for a user’s name and prints a greeting, showcasing Nero’s readability. The language is ideal for:

Beginners: Learning to code without complex syntax.
Educators: Teaching programming fundamentals.
Hobbyists: Experimenting with compiler design.
