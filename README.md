Nero: A Revolutionary Experimental Programming Language
Crafted by Arinara Network Studio
Nero is an open-source programming language designed to make coding as intuitive as speaking. With syntax like Tanyakan "Siapa namamu?" simpan ke nama (Ask "What is your name?" save to name), Nero bridges the gap between human expression and code. This repository, licensed under the MIT License, represents the final archive of Nero’s development, though the stable version may include variations by Arinara Network Studio.
