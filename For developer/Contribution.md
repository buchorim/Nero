Notes on Using Nero’s Codebase
This document provides guidance for those interested in studying or extending the Nero programming language, developed by Arinara Network Studio.

Note: The stable version of Nero may differ from this documentation due to changes by the development team. Always verify with the source code.

Project Context
Nero is an experimental project released as a final archive under the MIT license. Arinara Network Studio has no plans for further updates, but the open-source license allows anyone to use, modify, or build upon the code for personal, educational, or experimental purposes.
Purpose of This Guide
As a static archive, Nero is not designed for active collaboration. This guide is for:

Learners: Understanding Nero’s natural language-inspired syntax.
Researchers: Studying experimental compiler design.
Developers: Using Nero’s code as a foundation for new projects.

Guidelines for Use
If you wish to work with Nero’s code:

Understand the Project:
Read the documentation folder for Nero’s goals and structure.
Explore tutorials for practical examples.


Respect the License:
Any derivative work must comply with the MIT license (see root directory).


Test Modifications:
Since no updates are planned, test changes in your own environment.
Use stable compilers for reliable results.


Document Changes:
If you modify the code, consider maintaining notes similar to those in the documentation folder.



Example Workflow
To experiment with Nero:

Set up the environment (see setup guide).
Write a test program:Pake Nero
Tanyakan "Berapa umurmu?" simpan ke umur
Tampilkan "Umurmu " gabung umur gabung " tahun."
(Jalan)


Compile and test using a stable compiler.
Note any differences in the stable version’s behavior.


Reminder: The stable version may include or exclude features described here. Check the source code for the latest details.
