Nero Code and File Structure
This document details the organization and conventions of the Nero codebase, providing a roadmap for studying its design.

Note: The stable version of Nero may include changes to code or structure. Verify details in the source code.

Overview
Developed by Arinara Network Studio, Nero’s codebase is an experimental effort to create a natural language-inspired programming language. The repository is a final archive, but the stable version may reflect modifications by the development team.
Code Principles
Nero’s compilers adhere to:

Language: C, chosen for portability and performance.
Modularity: Functions are small and focused (e.g., parsing, code generation).
Safety: Includes checks for null pointers, buffer overflows, and memory leaks.
Style:
Indentation: 4 spaces.
Braces: K&R style (opening brace on the same line).
Comments: Concise, explaining function purpose and parameters.



Example Code Snippet
void log_error(const char *file, int line, const char *fmt, ...) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d: error: ", file, line);
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, fmt);
    vfprintf(stderr, fmt, args);
    va_end(args);
}

This function demonstrates Nero’s error reporting format.
File Organization
Compilers are stored in categorized directories, each containing:

Primary Source: A main file (e.g., compiler.c) serving as the compiler’s entry point.
Supporting Files: Documentation or test programs, if included.
Configuration: Settings for compilation, if applicable.

Code Components
A typical Nero compiler includes:

Main Function:
Handles command-line arguments (e.g., input file, --debug).
Coordinates parsing and code generation.


Parsing Logic:
Processes Nero syntax (e.g., Pake Nero, Tampilkan).
Uses functions like parse_output or parse_input.


Code Generation:
Outputs AArch64 machine code for ELF executables.
Manages variables and strings efficiently.


Error Handling:
Reports errors in the format compiler.c:<line>: error: <message>.
Cleans up resources on failure.


Memory Management:
Allocates buffers for code and strings.
Frees all resources before exiting.

Studying the Code
To explore Nero’s codebase:

Locate a Compiler: Find a stable compiler in the repository.
Read Comments: Look for in-code documentation.
Test with Examples: Use tutorials to run sample programs and observe compiler behavior.

This structure reflects Nero’s experimental yet disciplined approach to compiler design, making it a valuable resource for learning.
